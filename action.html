        <h3>Ethical Implications</h3>
        <p>Climate change creates stronger and dangerous typhoons, and as global citizens, we have the
            responsibility to reduce the harm that we cause to the environment, like waste management, flood control and
            global warming.
            Everyone has a duty to take part in actions that lower waste, protect vulnerable communities and support
            policies that address
            climate change and to lessen them.
